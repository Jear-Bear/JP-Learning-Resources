<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project serves as a portfolio website showcasing my skills and expertise in web development and interactive simulations. Built using **LiquidFun** and **Babylon.js**, the site features a dynamic simulation that integrates realistic 2D physics and immersive 3D graphics. 

The primary goal is to provide an engaging interactive experience, allowing users to manipulate objects and observe the effects of physics in real-time. Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency in utilizing cutting-edge technologies to create visually appealing and technically robust applications. 

This portfolio highlights my journey as a developer and my commitment to building innovative solutions that blend creativity with functionality.

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
## Acknowledgments

* Thanks to the LiquidFun team at Google for their open-source 2D physics engine, which really helped spice up my landing page.
For more details, visit the [LiquidFun GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/liquidfun).
* Special thanks to the Babylon.js team for their powerful and versatile game engine, which also helped me achieve a clean and positive UX on my landing page.
For more information, visit the [Babylon.js website](https://www.babylonjs.com).
* A big thanks to Andy Beaulieu, who used babylon.js and liquidfun in conjunction for sprite rendering--I was tearing my hair out trying to build a sprite library from the ground up before I found your [blog post](http://www.spritehand.com/2016/01/fluid-simulation-using-babylonjs-and.html).
